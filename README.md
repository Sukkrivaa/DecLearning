Open source this code only if you cannot find any funds at all to continue - then make it non-profit

Make sure you test running this on another computer after finishing the final version - dev dependencies and dependencies are mixed up

Just write one test to get things started


Because people can see your development history need to make a new project when pushing this live

go through the whole process of adding new stuff in so that you are accustomed to some of the problems.
    - Currently, adding a new subtopic is difficult. You had to do it via the other program - which you use to can use in production to push all the new text in so that the database is updated
    - Need to create a program where people can create a quillJS imput from scratch and give the resulting file a name as a new subtopic so that they can propose that we add it in - they should be able to download it
    - Create a slack group to work on a problem or request together (if we open source this)
    - Beneath each editable quill for requests and problems, have an wall of text explaining the purpose of this - mainly get feedback on what users want
